String x = "30";
String y = "20";

//this code will give you an error since it cant have double quotes within the text
//String txt = "We are the so-called "Gurus" from Stanford.";

//To fix the issue above, you add a backslash(/)
/*String txt= "We are the so-called \"Gurus\" from Stanford.";

//String txt = "It\'s alright.";
